For Task1 : https://pursottam6003.github.io/Everlytics-Task/
1. There are two approaches one is to create HTML Tables and insert  elements as table data and the other one was by using div , flex box (advance CSS) . 

2. I had tried by using the second approach. where I had used the CSS property to align the form elements , div elements .

3. For form validation I had used the html required pattern="[A-Za-z0-9_.]{5,}"   and it is able to satisfy the demands 

Minimum length 5
No special characters
Cannot start with '-', '_', '+'


For Task 2 :  https://pursottam6003.github.io/Everlytics-Task2/
1. For second task my approach is by using the basic HTML skeleton and then the JavaScript . 

2. To make table i had created the static HTML table heading then using the Json file I had inserted the elements into the table and at the end it would be displayed by simple click

3. Just Click on the button and you will get table information

Thank You
